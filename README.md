Stack Data Structure Problems & Solutions
Welcome to my repository of classic and advanced stack-based problems! This collection, curated and solved by Hritik, serves as a practical guide and personal log of my journey through algorithmic problem-solving focused on the Stack data structure.

üìñ Overview
This repository contains clean, efficient, and well-commented solutions to a variety of coding challenges involving stacks. The primary goal is to demonstrate different applications of stacks, from simple expression evaluation to more complex problems involving histograms and monotomic stacks. Each solution is implemented with a focus on clarity and optimal performance.

üöÄ How to Use
The solutions are self-contained within their respective files. To compile and run a solution:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

Navigate to a solution file and compile it using a C++ compiler (like g++):

g++ -std=c++17 -o output_file problem_file_name.cpp

For example:

g++ -std=c++17 -o Mah Mah.cpp

Run the executable:

./Mah
